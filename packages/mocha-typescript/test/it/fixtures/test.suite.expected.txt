    ✓ should pass when asserts are fine
    1) should fail when asserts are broken
    ✓ should pass async tests
    2) should fail async when given error
    - should fail async when callback not called
    ✓ should pass when promise resolved
    3) should fail when promise rejected

  CuteSyntax
    ✓ testNamedAsMethod
    ✓ can have non verbose syntax for fancy named tests
    ✓ and they can be async too

  LifeCycle
   - Before the suite: 1
     - new LifeCycle
       - Before each test 1
         - Run one: 1
    ✓ one
       - After each test 1
     - new LifeCycle
       - Before each test 2
         - Run two: 2
    ✓ two
       - After each test 2
   - After the suite4

  PassingAsyncLifeCycle
    ✓ one
    ✓ two

  Times
    ✓ when fast is normal
    ✓ when average is yellow-ish
    ✓ when slow is red-ish
    ✓ when faster than timeout passes
    6) when slower than timeout fails

  ExecutionControl
    - this won't run
    ✓ this however will
    ✓ add @only to run just this test

  MobileClient
    boot up server.

  WebClient
    boot up server.
      connect(shader connection 2)
    ✓ web can connect
